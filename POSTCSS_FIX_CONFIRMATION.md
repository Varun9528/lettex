# âœ… POSTCSS CONFIGURATION FIX CONFIRMATION
## Pachmarhi Tribal Art Marketplace - Build Error Resolution

## ðŸŽ¯ ISSUE RESOLVED

**Build Error Fixed:** 
```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. 
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS 
with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

## ðŸ”§ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. PostCSS Configuration Update
**File:** `postcss.config.js`

**Before (Incorrect):**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

**After (Correct):**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 2. Dependency Verification
Confirmed that `@tailwindcss/postcss` is already installed as a dev dependency in `package.json`:
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4",
  // ... other dependencies
}
```
