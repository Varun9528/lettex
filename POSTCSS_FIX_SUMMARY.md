# PostCSS and CSS Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

Fixed the PostCSS configuration error that was preventing the application from building and running properly:

```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. 
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS 
with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. PostCSS Configuration Update
**File**: `postcss.config.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 2. Next.js Configuration Update
**File**: `next.config.ts`

Added proper turbopack configuration to avoid workspace root detection issues:

```typescript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  // ... other config
  turbopack: {
    resolveAlias: {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  },
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### 3. Environment Cleanup
Removed stray `package-lock.json` file from user home directory that was causing workspace root detection warnings.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by:
1. Using the deprecated `tailwindcss` plugin directly in PostCSS configuration
2. Next.js 15's Turbopack requiring the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
3. Workspace root detection issues due to multiple package-lock.json files

## Verification

✅ PostCSS configuration now uses the correct `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
✅ Next.js development server starts without CSS compilation errors
✅ Tailwind CSS classes are properly applied to components
✅ Application is accessible at http://localhost:3010
✅ No more workspace root warnings

## Additional Improvements

1. **Turbopack Configuration**: Properly configured to avoid restart loops
2. **Path Aliases**: Added resolve aliases for better module resolution
3. **Port Management**: Application automatically uses available ports when 3000 is busy

## Next Steps

1. Test all pages to ensure CSS is properly applied
2. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
3. Check dark mode functionality
4. Confirm multilingual support is working
5. Test all interactive components (cart, wishlist, etc.)

The application should now build and run without any CSS-related errors.
