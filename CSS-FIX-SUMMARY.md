# CSS Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The CSS styling in the Pachmarhi Tribal Art Marketplace was not working properly after recent changes. All pages were displaying without proper styling, with no colors, padding, or layout applied.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Tailwind CSS Configuration Issues** - Potential conflicts between Tailwind v4 configuration and existing setup
2. **Caching Problems** - Next.js cache was preventing new styles from being applied
3. **Configuration Conflicts** - Multiple Tailwind config files may have been causing issues

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Tailwind Configuration Fix
- Updated `tailwind.config.ts` with proper content paths
- Verified theme extensions for custom colors
- Ensured plugins array is correctly configured

### 2. PostCSS Configuration Verification
- Confirmed `postcss.config.js` is using the correct plugins
- Verified `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin is properly configured
- Checked autoprefixer configuration

### 3. CSS Import Validation
- Verified `globals.css` imports Tailwind directives correctly
- Confirmed `layout.tsx` imports global styles properly
- Checked that CSS variables are properly defined

### 4. Cache Clearing
- Deleted `.next` directory to clear build cache
- Restarted development server to apply fresh builds

### 5. Testing Implementation
- Created CSS test pages to verify functionality
- Added comprehensive testing procedures
- Documented verification steps

## Files Modified

## Verification Steps
