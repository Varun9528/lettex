# Lettex Marketplace - Product Display Fix Summary

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The Geevi product images are now properly displayed on the homepage with all the required information.

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

1. **Database Seeding**: Successfully seeded 40 Geevi products from the images in `/public/images/products/`
2. **Product Information**: Each product displays:
   - Product Image (from `/images/products/[filename]`)
   - Product Name (derived from filename with underscores replaced by spaces)
   - Price (₹100 default for all products)
3. **Tribal Art Removal**: Old tribal art products have been removed from the database
4. **Correct Image Paths**: All products now use the correct image path: `/images/products/[filename]`

## ✅ **Verification Results**

- **Total Products Created**: 40 Geevi products
- **Product Names**: Generated from image filenames (e.g., "Geevi Atta Bag Studio Shot")
- **Prices**: All set to ₹100 as requested
- **Images**: All loading from `/images/products/` directory
- **Database**: Cleaned and populated with correct data

## 🚀 **How to View the Results**

1. Visit http://localhost:3001 (or http://localhost:3000 if port 3000 is available)
2. Navigate to the homepage or products page
3. You should see all 40 Geevi products displayed with:
   - Product images
   - Product names
   - ₹100 prices

## ✅ **Technical Details**

The seeding process:

3. Generated proper product names from filenames
4. Set default price to ₹100 for all products
5. Assigned products to the "Grocery" category
